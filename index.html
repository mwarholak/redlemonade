    <p>Thanks for landing at the home of Red Lemonade! Although we still publish the books that emerged out of this grand experiment in new model publishing, the social writing and reading element of Red Lemonade is now closed, and archived at the Internet Archive.</p>
    <p>To see how the social writing and reading experience existed at the time, you can view the archive at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315000140/http://redlemona.de/">https://web.archive.org/web/*/redlemona.de</a></p>
    <p>Weâ€™re so honored that so many great writers and readers participated in Red Lemonade while it was operating, and gratified to see the influence of this project on so many areas of book culture.</p>
    <p>For questions about the books still in print, please email Richard Nash at <a href="mailto:rnash@rnash.com?subject=Inquiry%20From%20Red%20Lemonade%20Web">rnash@rnash.com</a><br /></p>
    <p>Onwards,<br />
